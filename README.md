# Binary Conversions in Node, TypeScript and the Terminal

Convert Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary!

I made this little app to be my go-to for Binary conversions. Yeah sure there are websites you can find on Google that'll help me do that. But I'd rather just run a small lightweight app on my MacOS Terminal anytime I want to. Those websites can come and go, especially the free ones. And I don't want to have to always pick a website that'll help me when they stop working. Most of them have annoying Ads and can be slow to get results. Sometimes, I might have bad internet days (yes this exists to someone who works in the World Wide Web, lol). Really mostly, I just didn't want to have to convert things by hand anymore. 

After reviewing and re-understanding how to convert binary to decimal and decimal to binary, I decided to code the coversions so I'll never have to do it by hand EVER AGAIN, mwahahahah! Then I figured, why not make a NodeJS prompt using TypeScript and add Jest Unit Testing!

Also: The prompts should be straightfoward enough for usage instructions / nagivations. If not, let me knooooow!

## Get Started
### Install NodeJS and NPM
The link should give you an executable file that contains NodeJS and NPM.
https://nodejs.org/en/

### Download the app
Download the files to your local machine, or `git clone` it!

### Install TypeScript globally

`npm install -g typescript`

### Install all Depedencies
Make sure to be in the root directory of the project. Then, install the dependencies.

`npm install`

## Start the App

`npm run prod`

## Stop the App

Stop the app in regular NodeJS fashion
`Ctrl + C`

## Start Unit Test

`npm test`
